# api-weather-dashboard
simple weather dashboard using open weather apis

## Description 
- My motivation for this project was to learn about openweather apis, I built this project to create a wetaher dashboard for people that need to know the current weather forecast. This project gives the user a basic weather dashboard thats easy to use and find a forecast for any city in the world. While making this project I learned how to create and use open weather api and create an api key. I also learned how to use 'fetch api' to gather api data.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
When the user opens the application they are directed to the dashboard where they will see a serch form in the top left of the UI that will say 'Enter City' where they can input any city in the world and 'click' the search button. When the user enters a city name, the weather forecast is displayed for the current day and 5 days in the future.
